Setup:
 - Inspector
 - signal nodes
 - scene roots
 - file system
 - project settings
 - bottom tabs

controls
 - scrollwheel to move
Nodes 
 - all derive from the central "Node"
 - each unique node: "CharacterBody2D" extends from node and expands on what it can do
 - a scene is a container of nodes
 - the root node gives a base for what that node can do
 - the child nodes give that base purpose more features i.e.: giving a player collision or sprite
 - make a scene for each component in a game (Sword, player, level, enemy, effects) and combine them in a larger scene that acts as a level
 - scripts allow those nodes to do more unique things and interact with the enviroment around them
 - signals connect nodes together: something happens -> something else is triggered

Scenes
- folder for nodes
- create node2d
- add child
- save scene
- organize scenes in res
- make new scene

Nodes
- values
- child nodes
- root node
- general kinds of nodes:
	- sprite
	- Body
	- UI
	- UI controller
	- 
- get_node() or $node

Scripts
- get_node() or $node
- variables:
	- @export
	- @onready
	- var
- functions
- default functions:
	- _ready()
	- _process(delta)
	- _physics_process(delta)
	- _input(event)

Signals
 - how nodes talk to eachother
 - built in signals
 - emit_signal() ?
